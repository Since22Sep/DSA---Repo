   // What is Linked List:- It is a type of linear data structure which is formed by collection of nodes
    // nodes :- it displays data and also the address of next node

    // Why linked list:- Can you change the size of array at runtime..?? no
    // In case of vector we are taking new space, copying value and it is taking some time... so linked list is preferred

    // Linked List:- 
    // advantages..  -> It has dynamic data structure ( we can grow or shrink at runtime therefore no memory wastage) 
    //  ->insertion and deletion is easy in this case as no shift is needed. 
 /*
Drawbacks of Linked Lists: 
  - Random access is not allowed. We have to access elements sequentially starting from the first node(head node). So we cannot do a binary search with linked lists efficiently with its default implementation. 
  - Extra memory space for a pointer is required with each element of the list. 
  - Searching for an element is costly and requires O(n) time complexity.
